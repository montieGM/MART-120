		Hi there! My name is Ivy Olson, and I am the curator of this website. Although this will never see the light of day, I hope that those who see it enjoy the content that I have curated! Not only the content about myself, but the stories and art which I have written/found. All material that is not mine will be credited either under or in the "Bibliography" page.
